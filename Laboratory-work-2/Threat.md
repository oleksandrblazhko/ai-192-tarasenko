|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Information Disclosure|Data Flow Sniffing|Data flowing across Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations.|
|2|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Repudiation|Potential Data Repudiation by Verbum App|Verbum App claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary.|
|3|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Tampering|Potential Lack of Input Validation for Verbum App|Data flowing across Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Verbum App or an elevation of privilege attack against Verbum App or an information disclosure by Verbum App. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues.|
|4|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Spoofing|Spoofing the Mobile Client External Entity|Mobile Client may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Verbum App.|
|5|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Spoofing|Spoofing the Verbum App Process|Verbum App may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Mobile Client.|
|6|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Elevation Of Privilege|Elevation by Changing the Execution Flow in Verbum App|An attacker may pass data into Verbum App in order to change the flow of program execution within Verbum App to the attacker's choosing.|
|7|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Elevation Of Privilege|Verbum App May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution|Mobile Client may be able to remotely execute code for Verbum App.|
|8|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Elevation Of Privilege|Elevation Using Impersonation|Verbum App may be able to impersonate the context of Mobile Client in order to gain additional privilege.|
|9|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Denial Of Service|Data Flow Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction|
|10|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Denial Of Service|Potential Process Crash or Stop for Verbum App|Verbum App crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric.|
|11|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response|Repudiation|External Entity Mobile Client Potentially Denies Receiving Data|Mobile Client claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary.|
|12|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response|Spoofing|Spoofing of the Mobile Client External Destination Entity|Mobile Client may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being sent to the attacker's target instead of Mobile Client.|
|13|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response|Denial Of Service|Data Flow Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.|
|14|Verbum-App-Firebase-Request|Spoofing|Spoofing of Destination Data Store Firebase|Firebase may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Firebase.|
|15|Verbum-App-Firebase-Request|Denial Of Service|Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Verbum App or Firebase|Does Verbum App or Firebase take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.|
|16|Verbum-App-Firebase-Response|Spoofing|Spoofing of Source Data Store Firebase|Firebase may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to Verbum App.|
|17|Verbum-App-Firebase-Response|Information Disclosure|Weak Access Control for a Resource|Improper data protection of Firebase can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure.|
