|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Repudiation threats|External Entity Verbum App Potentially Denies Receiving Data|Verbum App claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.|
|2|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Request|Denial of Service|Data Flow Generic Data Flow Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.|
|3|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response|Repudiation threats|External Entity Mobile Client Potentially Denies Receiving Data|Mobile Client claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.|
|4|Mobile-Client-Verbum-App-Response|Denial of Service|Data Flow Generic Data Flow Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.|
|5|Verbum-App-DB-Request|Spoofing|Spoofing of Destination Data Store Firebase Database|Firebase Database may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Firebase Database. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.|
|6|Verbum-App-DB-Request|Tampering|Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability for Firebase Database|SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.|
|7|Verbum-App-DB-Response|Spoofing|Spoofing of Source Data Store Firebase Database|Firebase Database may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to Verbum App. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store.|
|8|Verbum-App-DB-Response|Information disclosure|Weak Access Control for a Resource|Improper data protection of Firebase Database can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings|
